The Illustrated Guide to Zhang Sanfeng's Original Tai Chi Chuan
Compiled by Mr. Wan Laisong

Mr. Wan Laisong, aged 30 in 1932, demonstrated the "Original Tai Chi Chuan" of Zhang Sanfeng at the Guoshu Training Institute in Hunan. This printed copy is now published domestically for the first time by Mr. Wan (aged 84) in order to clarify the origins of Tai Chi Chuan.

The original style of Zhang Sanfeng's Tai Chi Chuan is profound. His concept of "splitting Tai Chi" extends beyond pushing hands and can deal with any form of confrontation. Originally, Zhang-style Tai Chi was passed down to Liu Dekuan in Hebei, then from Liu to Zhao Xinzhou, and finally from Zhao to Wan Laisong. Currently, the martial arts community highly values Zhang-style Tai Chi as a rare treasure.

Mr. Wan originally produced the printing plates in vertical layout, but now they have been changed to horizontal format while retaining all other content. Additionally, the drawings have been redrawn.
